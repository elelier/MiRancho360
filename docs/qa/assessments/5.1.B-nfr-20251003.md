# NFR Assessment

Story: 5.1.B - Crear Componente Card Accesible
Date: 2025-10-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Scope
Assessed NFRs: security, performance, reliability, maintainability
Targets drawn from coding standards (accessible UI, Tailwind theme) and story acceptance criteria.

## Findings

### Security — PASS
- Card component stays presentational; no data IO or auth changes.
- Keyboard handlers guard repeat events, reducing accidental multi-trigger behavior (no spoofing vector).
- Recommendation: none.

### Performance — PASS
- Render logic is O(1); showcase page loads static data.
- Variant styling reuses Tailwind tokens; no dynamic layout thrash.
- Recommendation: include Card in future Lighthouse runs to monitor bundle impact.

### Reliability — PASS
- Updated Space/Enter handling prevents duplicate actions across devices (mitigates TECH-001).
- Demo route provides manual smoke surface; unit tests cover primary flows.
- Recommendation: add Playwright scenario once dashboard wiring exists.

### Maintainability — PASS
- Unit suite expanded (10 total tests) with >80% coverage.
- Card.md documents props and use cases; showcase route offers living examples.
- Recommendation: add `/demo/card` review to release checklist (mitigates OPS-001).

## Gate YAML
