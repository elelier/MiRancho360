# Risk Assessment

## Story: 5.1.B - Crear Componente Card Accesible

### Summary

- Story Scope: Shared Card UI component + showcase route
- Review Date: 2025-10-03
- Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
- Overall Story Risk Score: 90

### Top Risks

1. TECH-001 – Keyboard handling regressions in non-standard browsers
2. BUS-001 – Visual contrast drift when theme tokens change
3. OPS-001 – Demo route lagging behind production usage

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description                                        | Probability | Impact   | Score | Priority |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Space/Enter handlers may diverge across devices     | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4   | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Variants lose perceived contrast after palette tweak | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4   | Medium   |
| OPS-001  | Demo route /demo/card becomes stale vs actual flows | Low (1)    | Medium (2) | 2   | Low      |

### Risk Register

#### TECH-001 – Keyboard compatibility gaps
- Category: Technical
- Description: Event logic mirrors native button behavior, but some Android WebView or legacy browsers may fire keyup differently, producing double activations or missed clicks.
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Affected Components: `Card.tsx`
- Detection Method: Code review of custom key handlers
- Mitigation:
  - Add manual regression tests on target devices (Chrome Android, Safari iOS)
  - Include automated E2E smoke covering keyboard navigation once dashboard wiring is complete
- Residual Risk: Keep

#### BUS-001 – Contrast fidelity drift
- Category: Business/UX
- Description: Variants rely on Tailwind palette tokens; future palette adjustments might reduce seniors' ability to differentiate priority states.
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Affected Components: `Card.tsx`, theme tokens in `tailwind.config.js`
- Detection Method: Visual inspection reference vs design guidelines
- Mitigation:
  - Lock contrast thresholds in design acceptance tests (Lighthouse, Storybook accessibility add-on)
  - Document WCAG expectations in Card.md and enforce via design review checklist
- Residual Risk: Monitor

#### OPS-001 – Demo drift
- Category: Operational
- Description: Showcase route is behind auth and may not be updated when new variants or props are introduced, leading to QA blind spots.
- Probability: Low (1)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 2 (Low)
- Affected Components: `CardShowcasePage.tsx`, routes config
- Detection Method: Process review
- Mitigation:
  - Add demo page check to release checklist
  - Consider Storybook migration for shared components
- Residual Risk: Accept

### Risk-Based Testing Strategy

**Priority 1 – Medium Risks**
- Run focused manual keyboard navigation tests on mobile browsers (TECH-001)
- Execute contrast verification (Lighthouse accessibility, color pickers) for each variant (BUS-001)

**Priority 2 – Low Risks**
- Review showcase page during regression QA (OPS-001)

### Monitoring & Follow-up

- Add QA checklist item: confirm /demo/card renders latest props each release
- Track accessibility bug reports referencing Card usage for early warning
