# NFR Assessment – Story 5.1.C

Date: 2025-10-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Assessed NFRs: security, performance, reliability, maintainability
Quality Score: 90

## Security – PASS
- Scope limited to client-side presentation (React components); no new data flows or auth surfaces introduced.
- Input props continue to pass through controlled components; no direct handling of secrets.
- Risk BUS-001 focuses on accessibility, not security. No action required beyond standard regression.

## Performance – PASS
- Changes are Tailwind utility tweaks and conditional rendering; negligible runtime impact.
- Showcase page is dev-only; no production performance regression expected.
- Monitor bundle size if additional icons/assets are added later.

## Reliability – CONCERNS
- Success vs error precedence relies on consumer discipline; no automated test currently guards simultaneous props (see risk TECH-001).
- Manual accessibility validations (Lighthouse, SR) still pending; failures there could degrade perceived reliability of form feedback.
- Recommended actions: Implement test design item 5.1.C-UNIT-002 and schedule `/demo/input` validation runs.

## Maintainability – PASS
- Component API remains backwards-compatible; success prop optional.
- Documentation updated (`Input.md`) and targeted unit suite added, aiding future maintenance.
- Showcase route provides a quick sandbox for debugging states, improving observability.

### Recommended Follow-ups
1. Add unit test enforcing error-over-success precedence and integrate with CI gate.
2. Track completion of Lighthouse/axe/assistive-tech checks and archive evidence alongside this assessment.
